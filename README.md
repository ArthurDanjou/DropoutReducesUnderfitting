> **Study and reproduction of the paper:** Liu, Z., et al. (2023). *Dropout Reduces Underfitting*. arXiv:2303.01500.

This repository contains a robust and modular implementation in **TensorFlow/Keras** of **Early Dropout** and **Late Dropout** strategies. The goal is to verify the hypothesis that dropout, traditionally used to reduce overfitting, can also combat underfitting when applied solely during the initial training phase.

## 🎯 Scientific Objectives

The study aims to validate the three operating regimes of Dropout described in the paper:

1.  **Early Dropout** (Targeting Underfitting): Active only during the initial phase to reduce gradient variance and align their direction, allowing for better final optimization.
2.  **Late Dropout** (Targeting Overfitting): Disabled at the start to allow rapid learning, then activated to regularize final convergence.
3.  **Standard Dropout**: Constant rate throughout training (Baseline).
4.  **No Dropout**: Control experiment without dropout.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

Unlike naive Keras callback implementations, this project uses a **dynamic approach via the TensorFlow graph** to ensure the dropout rate is properly updated on the GPU without model recompilation.

### Key Components

* **`DynamicDropout`**: A custom layer inheriting from `keras.layers.Layer` that reads its rate from a shared `tf.Variable`.
* **`DropoutScheduler`**: A Keras `Callback` that drives the rate variable based on the current epoch and the chosen strategy (`early`, `late`, `standard`).
* **`ExperimentPipeline`**: An orchestrator class that handles data loading (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST), model creation (Dense or CNN), and execution of comparative benchmarks.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/arthurdanjou/dropoutreducesunderfitting.git](https://github.com/arthurdanjou/dropoutreducesunderfitting.git)
cd dropoutreducesunderfitting
```

##  Install dependencies
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 📊 Usage

The main notebook pipeline.ipynb contains all necessary code. Here is how to run a typical experiment via the pipeline API.
1. Initialization

Choose your dataset (cifar10, fashion_mnist, mnist) and architecture (cnn, dense).
```python
from pipeline import ExperimentPipeline

# Fashion MNIST is recommended to observe underfitting/overfitting nuances
exp = ExperimentPipeline(dataset_name="fashion_mnist", model_type="cnn")
```

2. Learning Curves Comparison

Compare training dynamics (Loss & Accuracy) of the three strategies.

```python
exp.compare_learning_curves(
    modes=["standard", "early", "late"],
    switch_epoch=10,  # The epoch where dropout state changes
    rate=0.4,         # Dropout rate
    epochs=30
)
```

3. Ablation Studies

Study the impact of the "Early" phase duration or Dropout intensity.

```python
# Impact of the switch epoch on final performance
exp.compare_switch_epochs(
    switch_epochs=[5, 10, 15, 20],
    modes=["early"],
    rate=0.4,
    epochs=30
)

# Impact of the dropout rate
exp.compare_drop_rates(
    rates=[0.2, 0.4, 0.6],
    modes=["standard", "early"],
    switch_epoch=10,
    epochs=25
)
```

4. Data Regimes (Data Scarcity)

Verify the paper's hypothesis that Early Dropout shines on large datasets (or limited models) while Standard Dropout protects small datasets.

```python
# Training on 10%, 50% and 100% of the dataset
exp.run_dataset_size_comparison(
    fractions=[0.1, 0.5, 1.0],
    modes=["standard", "early"],
    rate=0.3,
    switch_epoch=10
)
```

## 📈 Expected Results

According to the paper, you should observe:

- Early Dropout: Higher initial Loss, followed by a sharp drop after the switch_epoch, often reaching a lower minimum than Standard Dropout (reduction of underfitting).
- Late Dropout: Rapid rise in accuracy at the start (potential overfitting), then stabilized by the activation of dropout.
